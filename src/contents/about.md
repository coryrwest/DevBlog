My name is [Cory Westropp][1] and I am a self-taught developer. I find 
computers endlessly useful and interesting and have been tinking with 
them since I was 9.

This blog is a collection of problems I've figured out and tips I've 
gathered. The posts here are usually a collection of several tutorials, 
forum posts, stack overflow posts, etc. that lead to a sepcific solution 
to a specific problem.

At the time of writing the solution did not exist in one single place, 
which is why I compiled it here. For east referencing later, usually by me.
