I have been running my home network system off of several Raspberry Pi's and an ODROID U3 for almost a year now and I am starting to outgrow them. I have concocted a plan to build a home server based on Jeff Atwoods [HTPC build](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-2016-htpc-build/). His build is powerful, yet power efficient. Since my server will run 24/7 and power is somewhat expensive where I live power efficiency is key. That was the original motiviation behind the Pi's, they sip power.

I also have a small budget for such an endeavor, as this home server experiment of mine isn't exactly that popular with the wife. Another reason the Pi's were so easy. It would also be nice to have everything on one box instead of 4 SBC's. I also didn't need something as powerful as Atwood's HTPC since I would not be playing games or watching movies from it. Though it does not to be powerful enough to eventually transcode HD video for when I get OSMC/Plex up and running again.
