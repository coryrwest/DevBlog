I thought I woudl share how I set up Let's Encrypt on my home server since it wasn't the easiest thing to do and my friend recently had trouble with this.

Why is it not so easy?
-----------------------

I am not sure if things have changed since I did it, but it was difficult for me because most ISP's block port 80 on residential internet connections.
