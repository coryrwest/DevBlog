What I'm Hoarding
-----------------


Why
---

Ok so some would say that the reason I'm doing this isn't really rational, but I'm going to try to convince you otherwise. 
The fun reason that I tell people is "If the internet disappears tomorrow, what will you miss? What will you wish you had a 
copy of?". Or alternatively for the preppers out there, "If the apocalypse happens/government falls apart/[insert other 
doomsday scenario], won't you wish you had a slice of the internet to reference and help you survive?". Now the rational 
reason that I am hoarding this stuff is because it is all useful stuff to have in specific situations.

 - Advanced First Aid - If the power goes out for a couple days or weeks over a large area and someone gets hurt you can get all the information you'll need to help them with a laptop and a solar charger.
 - Recipes - The internet is constantly changing. What if your favorite recipe disappears from the internet because the site hosting it when belly up or they removed it for some reason.
 - Wikipedia, Wikisource, Wikiversity, etc. - Same reasons as both points above.
 - Other website mirrors - Same reasons again.

Am I crazy for spending so much time on this? Maybe. But I will be more prepared than you when shit hits the fan (if it ever does).
